- Readme
	- Especially about dictionary files
- Licencing?
- Check correspondence with JS version, esp:
	- Date Checker seems to reject two digit years? (cf. check_date) -- confirm
	- Date checker operates differently (i.e. it may return more matches in JS version) this should not affect end result -- confirm
- Should all match types have a cardinality? (spatial and date currently don't)
- Only create matchers once for lifetime of Zxcvbn object, but allow different user inputs for each password matching
- Provide a modified version of the frequency lists python script to just output the separate word lists
